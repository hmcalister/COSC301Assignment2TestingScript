# COSC301 Assignment 2 Testing Script

A short and sweet script to test (with some manual sections) the content of assignment 2. To use, first (from `clientpro`) run:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmcalister/COSC301Assignment2TestingScript/main/validation.sh`

Sorry for the horrendously long URL! As an alternative, if you cannot get your shared clipboard working to `clientpro`, feel free to get this script on your host OS and use a shared folder to move the script into your `clientpro` virtual machine. Finally, if you want to just use `wget` from your client, try using a URL shortner to minimize typing!

Here is a shortened URL from 10/05/2023: `wget https://shorturl.at/svEO1 -O validation.sh`

Once the script is safely on the VM, run:

`chmod +x validation.sh`

Then, after inspecting the script to ensure it is not malicious, run:

`sudo ./validation.sh`
